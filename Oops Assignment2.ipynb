    "# Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "# that are often used together but serve different purposes. Here's a differentiation between the two concepts in Python, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction\n",
    "# Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction is about simplifying complex systems by modeling classes or objects at the right level of detail,\n",
    "# focusing on their essential properties and behaviors while hiding unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How it is achieved:\n",
    "# In Python, abstraction is often achieved through abstract classes and methods, which define a blueprint for a class but leave some methods or attributes to be implemented by subclasses.\n",
